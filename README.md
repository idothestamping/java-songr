## Feature Tasks
* hello world route at /hello ensures that you can visit that route in your browser and see data come back.
* Capitalize route at /captialize turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, visit /capitalize/hello and get back the response HELLO.
* Reverse route at /reverse reverses the order of the words in a query parameter. For example, if I visit /reverse?sentence=Hello world, it should return world Hello.
* Spring RESTful Routing:
   * Create an Album model.
   * An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that albumâ€™s art.
   * A user should be able to see information about all the albums on the site.
   * A user should be able to add albums to the site.
